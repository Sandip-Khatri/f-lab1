1. partialApplication.fsx
- Implements a function power that raises a number to a given exponent.
- Demonstrates partial application by creating square and cube functions.
- Shows how to use these partially applied functions with example values.

2. tailRecursion1.fsx
- Implements a tail recursive function productOfList to calculate the product of all elements in a list.
- Uses an accumulator to optimize recursion and avoid stack overflow.
- Includes a test example with a sample list.

3. tailRecursion2.fsx
- Implements a tail recursive function productOfOdds to calculate the product of all odd numbers from a given odd number down to 1.
- Decrements by 2 in each recursive call to only include odd numbers.
- Includes a test example with the number 11.

4. mapFunction.fsx
- Demonstrates the use of the map function to trim whitespace from each string in a list.
- Uses a named function for clarity.
- Prints the cleaned list of names.

5. filterReduceIntegers.fsx
- Creates a list of integers from 1 to 700.
- Uses filter to select numbers divisible by both 5 and 7.
- Uses fold to sum the filtered numbers.
- Prints the resulting sum.

6. filterReduceStrings.fsx
- Filters a list of names to include only those containing the letter "I" (case-insensitive).
- Uses fold to concatenate the filtered names into a single string.
- Prints the concatenated result.

I am confused in couple of things like tailRecursion1.fsx and map Fucntion also  in  filterReduceIntegers.fsx I used the chatgpt to get the Idea.
